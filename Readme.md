# IoT-workshop

This repository contains simple excercise for IoT workshop.  

It uses [Wemos D1 MINI](https://www.wemos.cc/product/d1-mini.html) as a board based on ESP8266 and [PlatformIO](http://platformio.org/) as IDE.

Excercise purpose is to create LED ladder using 4xLED controlled by potentiometer.  

1. 4 LED  with resistors to inputs:
- D1
- D2
- D3
- D4
2. Connect potentiometer to analog input A0
3. Connect LED display with TM1637 driver to D0 and D5

There are two branches:
1. before - initial project setup with PlatformIO with board selected
2. after - branch with all code required to have excercise up and running
